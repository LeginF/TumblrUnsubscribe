tumblrUnsubscribe
=================
Script to automatically unsubscribe from 
abandoned tumbler feeds. This is based on 
a script from eJohnny (dev.ejohnny.ro). 
His script stopped after 80 feeds when
run on modern version of Tumblr. To overcome
this issue, I added a do-while loop that
will enable to script to run until it 
makes a loop without unsubscribing to any
feeds. 

How to Use
----------
1. Open tumblr
2. Open the list of followers
3. Scroll all the way to the bottom
4. Open the developer console
5. Select the console tab
6. Copy and paste the code to the 
console tab.
7. Hit enter and watch it run.
